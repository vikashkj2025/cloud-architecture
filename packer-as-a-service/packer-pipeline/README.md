This describes how packer pipeline can be created in AWX.
Using AWX, instead of a cloud native tool like codepipeline, codebuild or Azure Devops pipeline:
a. AWX is free and opensource. We can run the pipeline as many times we want without worrying about the cost.
b. We do not need to set up separetly for each cloud and non-cloud platform. AWX can give us a centralized location to run all the pipelines.
